# To-Do List Web App

This is a simple web app that allows users to create, manage, and track their to-do list. Users can add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks from the list. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Remove tasks from the list.
- Tasks are persisted using `localStorage`, so they are saved even after refreshing the page.
